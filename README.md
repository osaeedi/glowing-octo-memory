Heyy!!

It's the 16th march 2017 and I am just testing GitHub. I think it is shit that you just can make private repository, if you pay.
Today I went to the classes Algorithm and Prohability and Design of Digital Circuits. Then i visited the Exercise-Lecture of Algorithm and Prohability. Now I am sitting here typing these random words.
